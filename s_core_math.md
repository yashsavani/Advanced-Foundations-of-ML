# Core Math

Before diving into some of the more advanced math concepts, I would encourage you to at least cursorily go through some of the core math resources provided here. I recommend doing this even if you think you are comfortable with all the topics listed below. I can't count the number of times I thought I completely understood some core math concept, only to later realize that there was some subtlety I had neglected. These neglected subtleties can often have a cascading effect making it very hard to understand some of the more advanced material that rely on a solid core.

## Problem Solving (Entry, Attack, Review)

- Problems are ones that:
	- Engage intellect
	- Make connections to develop a coherent framework
	- Can be solved in more than one way
	- Should foster effective communication of mathematical ideas
-  Phases of Problem Solving:
	- Entry: what do I know (question, experience), what do I want (paraphrase, ambiguities), what can I introduce (diagram, notation).
	- Attack: brute force, look for patterns.
	- Review: check, reflect, extend, understand why it works.

One excellent resource I have found for some of this material is the playlist [Introduction to Higher Mathematics](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZzHxk_TPOStgPtqRZ6KzmkUQBQ8TSWVX). I recommend going through this playlist at least once.

A crucial tool in the machine learning toolbox is calculus. Most of the machine learning literature makes extensive use of multivariable calculus. However, before diving into the nuances of multivariable calculus, it's important to make sure you have a solid foundation and intuition for single variable calculus first. To gain the intuition I would recommend a [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr) by 3Blue1Brown, or [this course](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-bc) on AP calculus from Khan Academy. If you already have a strong calculus foundation, you can safely skip this section. Though, I would still encourage you to go through [the essence of calculus playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr) by 3Blue1Brown at some point though. It helps fill in a lot of intuition that more formal classes may have missed. Who knows? You may learn something you didn't realize you had missed. Even small insights in the foundations can lead to major revelations later on.

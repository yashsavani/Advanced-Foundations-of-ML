# Core Math

Before diving into some of the more advanced math concepts, I would encourage you to at least cursorily go through some of the core math resources provided here. I recommend doing this even if you think you are comfortable with all the topics listed below. I can't count the number of times I thought I completely understood some core math concept, only to later realize that there was some subtlety I had neglected. These neglected subtleties can often have a cascading effect making it very hard to understand some of the more advanced material that rely on a solid core.

## Problem Solving

### Problems are ones that:
* Engage intellect
* Make connections to develop a coherent framework
* Can be solved in more than one way
* Should foster effective communication of mathematical ideas

### Phases of problem solving:
* *Entry:* what do I know (question, experience), what do I want (paraphrase, ambiguities), what can I introduce (diagram, notation).
* *Attack:* brute force, look for patterns.
* *Review:* check, reflect, extend, understand why it works.

## Propositional Logic

* Propositional Logic is the foundation for the language of reason.
* A *proposition* is a statement that has one and only one truth value, $\true$ or $\false$.
* *Propositional variables* are letters used to stand in for actual propositional statements.
They are usually $p, q,$ or $r$.
* *Propositional connectives* are symbols used to connect propositional variables together.
* *Propositional expressions* are statements that link together propositional variables with potentially multiple propositional connectives.
* A *truth table* is a table that exhaustively lists all the possible truth values of the expressions.
* *Logical equivalence* (denoted by $\iff$ or $\equiv$) is when two propositional expressions are equivalent. That is, they take on the same truth value for every possible input.

### Common connectives
* *Tautology or $\top$:* $\top(p)$ is always $\true$ no matter what truth value $p$ takes. Usually when we try to prove something, we want to show that it is equivalent to a tautology, which means it is true no matter what the input truth values.
* *Negation or NOT or $\lnot$ or $\bar{p}$:* $\lnot p$ is $\true$ if and only if $p$ is $\false$.
* *Conjunction or AND or $\land$:* $p \land q$ is $\true$ if and only if $p$ and $q$ are both $\true$.
* *Inclusive Disjunction or OR or $\lor$:* $p \lor q$ is $\true$ if and only if either $p$ or $q$ or both are $\true$.
* *Exclusive Disjunction or XOR or $\oplus$:* $p \oplus q$ is $\true$ if $p$ and $q$ have different truth values.
* *Implication or Conditional or IMPLIES or $\to$:* $p \to q$ is $\false$ if and only if $p$ is $\true$ and $q$ is $\false$.
    * $p$ is called the  *antecedent*, and $q$ is called the *consequent*.
    * The *converse* of $p \to q$ is $q \to p$. It is not equivalent to $p \to q$.
    * The *inverse* of  $p \to q$ is $\lnot p \to \lnot q$. It is not equivalent to $p \to q$.
    * The *contrapositive* of  $p \to q$ is $\lnot q \to \lnot p$. It is equivalent to $p \to q$.
* *Biconditional or IFF or $\leftrightarrow$:* $p \leftrightarrow q$ is $\true$ if and only if both $p$ and $q$ have the same truth value.

### Truth table for common connectives
| $p$ | $q$ | $\lnot p$ | $p \land q$ |  $p \lor q$ | $p \oplus q$ | $p \to q$ |  $p \leftrightarrow q$ |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |

### Order of operations

As a convention, we evaluate any propositional expression in the following order:

1. Parantheses,
2. Negation,
3. Conjunction (left to right),
4. Inclusive disjunction (left to right),
5. Implication, and
6. Biconditional.

### De Morgan's theorem

One important theorem in propositional logic that appears everywhere is De Morgan's theorem. The theorem states that:

\begin{align*}
    \lnot(p \land q) &\equiv \lnot p \lor \lnot q, \text{and}\\
    \lnot(p \lor q) &\equiv \lnot p \land \lnot q.
\end{align*}

We can prove this by showing that the truth tables for the expressions are equivalent.

## Set Theory

* A *set* is a collection of members / elements.
* *Roster notation* explicitly lists out every element of the set (e.g. $A=\{1,2,3,4,5\}, B=\{2,4,6,10\}$).
* *Set builder notation* implicitly describes all the elements in a set (e.g. $A=\{x \mid x\text{ is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive}\},$ here $x$ is a dummy variable).
* To denote that an object is an element of a set we use the symbol $\in$ (e.g. $3 \in A$). Note that this is a valid proposition.
* To denote that on object is not an element of a set we use the symbol $\not\in$ (e.g. $10 \not\in A$). Note that this is also a valid proposition.
* Elements cannot appear more than once in a set, though they can appear more than once in a multiset.
* A set is not ordered.
* The *universal set* is the set of all the objects being considered. It is usually notated as $\mathcal{U}$.
In our case we may assume that $\mathcal{U} = \{x \mid x$ is an integer between 1 and 10 inclusive $\}$
* The *null set or empty set* is the set containing no elements. It is notated as $\varnothing = \{ \}$.
* Set theory has operators to combine sets.
* *Venn diagrams* are a visual representation of sets and the operations on sets.

### Set operators

* *Complement or $^c$:*
$A^c = \{ x \mid \lnot(x \in A) \}$ (e.g. $A^c = \{6, 7, 8, 9, 10\}$).

* *Intersection or $\cap$:*
$A \cap B = \{x \mid x \in A \land x \in B\}$ (e.g. $A \cap B = \{2,4\}$).
Note that the intersection is *associative*. That is, $(A \cap B) \cap C = A \cap (B \cap C) = A \cap B \cap C$.

* *Union or $\cup$:*
$A \cup B = \{x \mid x \in A \lor x \in B\}$ (e.g. $A \cup B = \{1,2,3,4,5,6,8,10\}$).
Note that the union is *associative*. That is, $(A \cup B) \cup C = A \cup (B \cup C) = A \cup B \cup C$.

* *Difference or $\setminus$:*
$A \setminus B = \{x \mid x \in A \land x \not\in B\}$ (e.g. $A \setminus B = \{1,3,5\}$).

* *Symmetric difference or $\Delta$:*
$A \Delta B = \{x \mid x \in A \oplus x \in B\}$ (e.g. $A \Delta B = \{1,3,5,6,8,10\}$).

### Subsets, supersets, and equality

Three other propositional statements for sets are the subset, superset, and equality relations.

* We say that a set $D$ is a subset *subset* of a set $A$, if every element $x \in D$ is also an element of $A$. Formally, we can write this as $\forall x, x \in D \to x \in A$. It is notated as $D \subseteq A$.
* We say that a set $A$ is a *superset* of a set $D$, if every element $x \in D$ is also an element of $A$. the superset proposition is essentially the reverse of the subset proposition. We notate this by $A \supseteq D$.
* We say that a set $A$ is *equivalent* to a set $D$ if it is both a superset and a subset of $D$. Formally, we can write this as $\forall x, x\in D \leftrightarrow x \in A$. We notate this by $A = D$.

We say that $D$ is a strict subset of $A$ if $D \subseteq A$, but $D \not= A$. In this case we write $D \subset A$. We can reverse the statement to get strict supersets ($A\supset D$).

A trivial statement that is always true is that $\varnothing \in C$ for all possible sets $C$. We say that this is true vacuously or true in an empty sort of way.

Another such trivial statement is that every set is a subset of itself since it is equal to itself.

### Special sets

Some special sets that we often consider are:

* The set of *natural numbers*, $\N = \{1,2,3,4,\ldots\}$ (some people claim $0 \in \N$).
* The set of *integers*, $\Z = \{\ldots,-2,-1,0,1,2,\ldots\}$.
* The set of *rational numbers*, $\Q = \left\{x \mid x = \frac{p}{q}, \where p,q \in \Z \right\}$.
* The set of *real numbers*, $\R$ that are the completion of $\Q$.
* The set of *irrational numbers* given by $\R \setminus \Q$.
* The set of *complex numbers*,
$\C = \{x \mid x = a + ib, \where a,b \in \R \land i = \sqrt{-1}\}$.

From the definitions we can see that $\N \subset \Z \subset \Q \subset \R \subset \C$.

### Russell's paradox, families of sets, and index sets

A set cannot contain itself. If we let this be the case then we get a paradox.
The paradox comes from the set $A = \{X \mid X \not\in X \}$.
That is, the set that contains all sets which do not contain themselves.
If $A$ is an element of $A$, then $A$ must not be in the set, but then it must be in the set.
This leads to a contradiction.
To avoid this kind of paradox, we accept a system of 9 axioms governing everything we can call a set and everything we can do with a set. We call this set of axioms ZFC or Zermeloâ€“Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice.

We call a set comprised of other sets a family of sets. We usually denote such families of sets with a uppercase script character like $\mathcal{F}$.

Index sets are sets that are used to enumerate the elements of a set, though they don't need to be a set of numbers. They are sometimes used with families of sets to enumerate the sets contained within the family.
For example, $\mathcal{F} = \{L_1, L_2, \ldots\}, \where L_i = \{p \mid p \in \mathcal{P} \land p \leq i\}$,
so $L_{10} = \{2,3,5,7\}$.
An index set might be $\mathcal{I} = \{1,2,\ldots,100\}$ and it can be used to index the $L_i$ sets of $\mathcal{F}$ for $i \in \mathcal{I}$.

## Predicate Logic

* Linguistically a proposition needs to be a declarative sentence with a subject, which is a noun phrase, and a predicate, which is a verb phrase.
* We can represent the subject by an element of a set and store the predicate separately
(e.g. $p(x) =$ "x is an even number", where $x$ is a free variable and $p$ is the predicate).
* The *truth set* of $p$ is the set of all  $x$ for which $p(x)$ is $\true$. That is, the truth set of $p$ is $\{x \mid p(x)\}$.
* *Quantifiers* tell us how big our truth set is.
* The *universal quantifier or "for all x, p(x)" or $\forall x, p(x)$* says that $p(x)$ is $\true$ for every possible element of our universal set.
    * $(\forall b \in B, p(b)) \iff (\forall b, (b \in B \to p(b)))$ is a useful identity for when we want to say something about every element in a non universal set $B$.
* The *existential quantifier or "there exists x such that p(x)" or $\exists x, \st p(x)$* says that there exists an $x$ in the universal set such that p(x) is $\true$.
    * $(\exists a \in A, \st p(a)) \iff (\exists a, \st (a \in A \land p(a)))$ is a useful identity for when we want to say something about some element of a non universal set $A$.
    * Sometimes we want to say that there exists a unique element for which $p(x)$ is $\true$. In this case we use the notation $\exists! x, \st p(x)$ to say that there exists exactly one element $x \in \mathcal{U}$ that is in the truth set of $p(x)$.
* We can see that $\forall b \in B, p(b) \implies \exists b \in B, \st p(b)$ is trivially true. This tells us that any statement with a universal quantifier is a stronger than one with an existential quantifier.
* We can also combine quantifiers to get compound quantifiers.
    * $\forall x, \exists y, \st (x < y)$ is $\true$ for all natural numbers.
    * $\exists y, \st \forall x, \st (x < y)$ is $\false$ for all natural numbers since there is no largest natural number.
* We can also negate quantifiers.
    * $\lnot \forall x, p(x) \iff \exists x, \st \lnot p(x)$.
    * $\lnot \exists x, \st p(x) \iff \forall x, \lnot p(x)$.
* For a family of sets $\mathcal{F}$, we say that $\bigcup_{A \in \mathcal{F}} A = \{a | \exists A \in \mathcal{F}, \st a \in A\}$
* For a family of sets $\mathcal{F}$, we say that $\bigcap_{A \in \mathcal{F}} A = \{a | \forall A \in \mathcal{F}, a \in A\}$

One excellent resource I have found for some of this material is the playlist [Introduction to Higher Mathematics](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZzHxk_TPOStgPtqRZ6KzmkUQBQ8TSWVX). I recommend going through this playlist at least once.

A crucial tool in the machine learning toolbox is calculus. Most of the machine learning literature makes extensive use of multivariable calculus. However, before diving into the nuances of multivariable calculus, it's important to make sure you have a solid foundation and intuition for single variable calculus first. To gain the intuition I would recommend a [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr) by 3Blue1Brown, or [this course](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-bc) on AP calculus from Khan Academy. If you already have a strong calculus foundation, you can safely skip this section. Though, I would still encourage you to go through [the essence of calculus playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr) by 3Blue1Brown at some point though. It helps fill in a lot of intuition that more formal classes may have missed. Who knows? You may learn something you didn't realize you had missed. Even small insights in the foundations can lead to major revelations later on.

\chapter{Meta Tools}

Before you start this journey, I would recommend making sure you have a solid arsenal of meta tools that will expedite your acquisition and integration of the new concepts you will be learning. These are tools like a good code and manuscript editor (I use neovim with plugins. See my [dotfiles](https://github.com/yashsavani/dotfiles) for my configuration), a good reference manager (I use Zotero, but I've heard good things about Mendeley as well), and a good concept management system (I use Zettelkasten: for an introduction to this system look at [this blog post](https://zenkit.com/en/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-the-zettelkasten-method/). For a deeper dive, read [How to Take Smart Notes](https://www.amazon.com/How-Take-Smart-Notes-Nonfiction/dp/1542866502)).

I also generally prefer videos over textbooks to learn new material. Unfortunately, the speed of any video tends to vary a lot and does not necessarily match my comfort level with the material. I use the [Video Speed Controller](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-speed-controller/nffaoalbilbmmfgbnbgppjihopabppdk) chrome extension to dial in the speed I want.

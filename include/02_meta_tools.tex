Before you start this journey, I would recommend making sure you have a
solid arsenal of meta tools that will expedite your acquisition and
integration of the new concepts you will be learning. These are tools
like a good code and manuscript editor (I use neovim with plugins. See
my \href{https://github.com/yashsavani/dotfiles}{dotfiles} for my
configuration), a good reference manager (I use Zotero, but I've heard
good things about Mendeley as well), and a good concept management
system (I use Zettelkasten: for an introduction to this system look at
\href{https://zenkit.com/en/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-the-zettelkasten-method/}{this
blog post}. For a deeper dive, read
\href{https://www.amazon.com/How-Take-Smart-Notes-Nonfiction/dp/1542866502}{How
to Take Smart Notes}).

I also generally prefer videos over textbooks to learn new material.
Unfortunately, the speed of any video tends to vary a lot and does not
necessarily match my comfort level with the material. I use the
\href{https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-speed-controller/nffaoalbilbmmfgbnbgppjihopabppdk}{Video
Speed Controller} chrome extension to dial in the speed I want.
